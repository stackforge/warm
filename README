Warm - To setup simple OpenStack environments from template
===========================================================

  Warm exposes APIs on Yaml files to be reused. I's good tool to setup
small environement on OpenStack.

Please report me any bug or feature. I will be happy to work on it.

Note: Warm mixup names and ids, It does not recreate resource 
already exists with a same name/id.

How to use it:
==============

  - To install Warm use pip (don't forget to check for dependances).
$ pip install warm
  
  - We are assuming your env OS_* are already configured.
$ export | grep OS_
declare -x OS_AUTH_URL="https://identity/v2.0"
declare -x OS_PASSWORD="*******"
declare -x OS_TENANT_ID="ea262aa012f244f8af2d1687977aaa81"
declare -x OS_TENANT_NAME="my-project"
declare -x OS_USERNAME="sferdjaoui"

  - You are now ready to create your first template.
$ cat > my-tpl.yaml <<EOF
server:
- name: srv
  flavor: m1.small
  image: cirros-0.3.1-x86_64-uec
EOF

  - You can now run warm.
$ warm my-tpl.yaml

To get more information about a template syntax, see config.yaml.sample or

more examples.
